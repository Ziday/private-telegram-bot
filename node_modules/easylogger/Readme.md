  Easy winston logger builder by json files
  This project is based in winston logger. More info here:
    https://github.com/winstonjs/winston


## Installation

  With npm :
    npm install easylogger

  If you prefer git:
    git clone https://github.com/GuillermoPena/easyLogger.git


## Default Configuration File


```javascript
{ "enabled": true
, "defaultLanguage": "es"
, "transports": [
    {
      "type":"Console"
    , "enabled": true
    , "colorize": true
    , "level": "debug"
    , "formatter": "consoleFormatter"
    }
  , {
      "type":"File"
    , "enabled": true
    , "filename": "./bot.log"
    , "json": false
    , "formatter": "fileFormatterWithTimestamp"
    , "level": "info"
    }
  , {
      "type":"DailyRotateFile"
    , "enabled": true
    , "filename": "./bot.log"
    , "datePattern": ".yyyyMMdd"
    , "json": false
    , "formatter": "fileFormatterWithTimestamp"
    , "level": "info"
    }
  ]
}
```

Transport options are winston transport options
You can add or remove any winston transport adding field 'enabled' which you can use to (dis)activate logger
If you want change any option, you can do it without restart your app. It will be detected it and logger will be rebuilt automatically.

## Tests


```javascript
var EasyLogger = require("easylogger")
var logger = new EasyLogger()
logger.print("Hi!")

logger.setCustomFormatter('File', function(){
  return '[[' + args.message + ']]';
})
logger.print("Bye!")
```

With default configuration file, this example will log 'Hi' in console, in a file and in a rotate file.
Then, it will write 'Bye!' in same transporters but, in file, it will log with a different format (in double brackets)
